# AdventureWorks ETL and Analytics Pipeline

This project implements a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for data from the AdventureWorks database, moving through various stages of transformation and analysis. Using SSIS for data orchestration, Azure Synapse and Power BI for visualization, and machine learning models for advanced analytics, the project provides insights such as customer segmentation, reseller churn, and product recommendations.

## Project Overview

This project builds a robust data warehousing and analytics solution for the AdventureWorks dataset, using ETL processes in SSIS to transform and load data into a structured data warehouse. Final analyses are performed in Power BI and Azure Synapse to provide insightful visualizations. Additionally, machine learning models are applied for customer segmentation, reseller churn prediction, and product recommendations for targeted customers.

## Architecture

1. **AdventureWorks Source** → **Staging Layer Database** → **Data Warehouse**
2. **Power BI / Azure Synapse Analytics** for Data Visualizations
3. **Machine Learning Models** for Predictive Analytics

## Technologies Used

- **SQL Server Managemnet Services (SSMS)** for Data Warehouse construction
- **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)** for ETL
- **Azure Synapse Analytics** for data visualization
- **Power BI** for data visualization and reporting
- **Python / ML Libraries** for customer segmentation and prediction models

## Data Pipeline Process

### 1. ETL from Source to Staging
The initial phase of the ETL pipeline extracts data from the **AdventureWorks Source** database and loads it into a **staging layer** database. Key processes include:
- Using SSIS to orchestrate data extraction from the source.
- Loading data into staging tables that mirror the raw source structure.

### 2. ETL from Staging to Data Warehouse
After data is in the staging layer, additional transformation steps occur to prepare it for analysis:
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure data consistency.
- **Data Transformation**: Aggregation, joining tables, and applying business rules.
- **Loading**: Populate fact and dimension tables in the data warehouse, providing a structure optimized for analysis.

### 3. Data Transformation and Denormalization
In this stage, data in the warehouse is further transformed to allow easy access for reporting and analytics:
- **Denormalization**: Data is aggregated and denormalized to reduce complexity for downstream processes.
- **Schema Design**: Implement a star schema to enhance query performance in the data warehouse.

### 4. Data Visualization and Analysis
The structured data is imported into **Power BI** and **Azure Synapse Analytics** for visualization:
- **Power BI Dashboards**: Use Power BI to visualize key metrics and create interactive dashboards.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Perform additional transformations and visualizations using the Synapse Studio.

### 5. Machine Learning Analysis
Leverage machine learning models for further insights:
- **Customer Segmentation**: Cluster customers into segments based on purchasing behavior and demographics.
- **Reseller Churn Prediction**: Identify patterns in data to predict which resellers might churn.
- **Product Recommendations**: Generate product recommendations tailored to specific customers based on purchase history.

## Project Setup

1. **Database Setup**: Ensure you have the AdventureWorks database installed on your SQL Server.
2. **SSIS Setup**: Install and configure SSIS on your server.
3. **Power BI**: Connect Power BI to your data warehouse for dashboard development.
4. **Azure Synapse**: Configure Synapse Analytics workspace if using Azure for visualizations.
5. **Machine Learning**: Set up Python and necessary libraries for model development.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure your connection strings and data sources in SSIS packages.
3. Run the SSIS packages to load and transform data.
4. Use Power BI or Azure Synapse to visualize the processed data.
5. Apply machine learning models to generate advanced analytics.
